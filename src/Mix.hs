-- ===== EXAMPLE SOLUTIONS AND HINTS =====
-- These would typically be provided separately or as comments

{-
Key insights for solving these problems:

1. Generic monad questions (Q1-15): Focus on the structure of monadic computation
   - Use bind (>>=) to chain operations
   - Use return/pure to wrap pure values
   - Think about what the monad provides (failure, state, logging, etc.)

2. State monad questions (Q16-35): Remember the state threading pattern
   - get to retrieve current state
   - put to update state
   - modify to transform state with a function
   - Use the sliding window pattern for sequence optimization

3. Writer monad questions (Q36-50): Focus on accumulating information
   - tell to add to the log
   - Use mappend (<>) to combine logs
   - Think about what information you want to collect

4. Reader monad questions (Q51-60): Think about shared context
   - ask to access the environment
   - local to run computation with modified environment
   - Think about what context each
