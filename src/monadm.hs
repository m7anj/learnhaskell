-- Q1: Monad Functionality
-- Define a function that takes an integer and returns a `Maybe` type, 
-- representing a successful result (Just) or an error (Nothing) 
-- depending on whether the integer is positive or not.

maybePositive :: Monad m => Int -> m Int
maybePositive x =
    let result = if x < 0
        then Nothing
        else (Just (number))
    return (result)

-- Q2: General Monad Usage
-- Write a function that returns the first element from a list wrapped in a `Monad m`.
-- If the list is empty, return Nothing.

safeHead :: Monad m => [a] -> m a
safeHead [] = return (Nothing)
safeHead xs = case xs of
    [] -> return Nothing
    (x:_) -> return (Just x)

-- Q3: State Monad
-- Implement a function that uses the `State` monad to increment a counter by a given value.

incrementCounter :: Monad m => Int -> StateT Int m ()
incrementCounter n = do
    value <- get
    let newValue = value + n
    put (newValue)
    return ()

-- Q4: Writer Monad
-- Define a function that uses the `Writer` monad to calculate the factorial of a number 
-- while keeping track of the number of recursive calls.

factorialWithLog :: Monad m => Integer -> WriterT [String] m Integer
factorialWithLog 0 = tell ["Base Case: 0! = 1"] return 1
factorialWithLog 1 = tell ["Base Case: 1! = 1"] return 1
factorialWithLog n = 
    -- something inbetween here right?
    tell ["Computing factorial of " ++ show n]
    next <- factorialWithLog (n - 1)
    let result = n * next
    tell ["Factorial of " ++ show n ++ " is " ++ show result]
    return result

-- Q5: Maybe Monad with Error Handling
-- Using the `Maybe` monad, write a function that calculates the division of two numbers.
-- If the denominator is zero, return Nothing; otherwise, return the result wrapped in Just.

safeDivide :: Monad m => Int -> Int -> m Int
safeDivide num denom = undefined

-- Q6: List Monad
-- Write a function that generates all combinations of two lists using the List Monad.

combineLists :: Monad m => [a] -> [b] -> m (a, b)
combineLists xs ys = undefined

-- Q7: Combining Monads
-- Use the `State` and `Writer` monads together to create a function 
-- that increments a counter and logs the result, while returning the incremented value.

stateWriterExample :: Monad m => StateT Int (WriterT [String] m) Int
stateWriterExample = undefined

-- Q8: Error Handling in List Monad
-- Create a function that generates a list of all possible results of a function application 
-- on a list of integers, but only include those results that are positive (use guards).

positiveResults :: Monad m => [Int] -> m Int
positiveResults xs = undefined

-- Q9: Reader Monad
-- Write a function that calculates the discount price of an item given an original price 
-- and a percentage discount. Use the `Reader` monad to pass the discount percentage.

applyDiscount :: Monad m => ReaderT Float m Float
applyDiscount = do
    discount = ask
    return $ (1 - discount)

-- Q10: Complex Monad Combination
-- Define a function that takes a string and performs a series of transformations using 
-- different monads: 
-- 1. Reverse the string (use the List Monad)
-- 2. Convert it to uppercase (use the Writer Monad)
-- 3. Check if itâ€™s a palindrome (use the Maybe Monad for error handling)

transformString :: Monad m => String -> m String
transformString str = undefined




applyNTimes :: Monad m => m a -> (a -> m a) -> Int -> m [a]
applyNtimes mx mf 0 = do
    return [mx]
applyNtimes mx mf n = do
    result <- mx
    rest <- applyNTimes (mf result) mf (n-1)
    return (result : rest)

-- Question 5: Monads and Game Logic (20 marks - Test 2 style, challenging)

-- Let initial = GameState 100 0
-- riskyMove 30 50 initial should give Just (GameState 70 50)
