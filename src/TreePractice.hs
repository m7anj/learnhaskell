-- ===== HELPER EXAMPLES =====
-- These show the style of thinking required

{-
Example for Q1 (nodesAtDepth):
nodesAtDepth 0 (Node 1 (Node 2 Empty Empty) Empty) = 1  -- just root
nodesAtDepth 1 (Node 1 (Node 2 Empty Empty) Empty) = 1  -- just Node 2
nodesAtDepth 2 (Node 1 (Node 2 Empty Empty) Empty) = 0  -- no nodes at depth 2

Example for Q4 (countLeaves):
countLeaves (Branch []) = 1  -- empty branch list = leaf
countLeaves (Branch [Leaf 1, Leaf 2]) = 2  -- two leaves
countLeaves (Branch [Branch []]) = 1  -- one leaf nested down

Example for Q21 (isBST):
isBST (Node 5 (Node 3 Empty Empty) (Node 7 Empty Empty)) = True
isBST (Node 5 (Node 7 Empty Empty) (Node 3 Empty Empty)) = False

The key is understanding what each operation means conceptually,
then implementing the recursive pattern correctly.
